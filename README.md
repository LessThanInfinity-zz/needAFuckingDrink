<h1>Need a F****** Drink</h1>

<p>This site was made because I wanted to tinker with google maps - not quite get into the depths of it, but definitely to check out their api. I wanted something small to try out, and, on a thirsty Friday night, came across this site:</p>

<a href="http://www.wtfsigfd.com/" target="_blank">Where the F*** should I go to drink</a>

<p>The idea is simple: use your location to find bars nearby and plot a route. The idea is unchanged in my clone:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ask user for location</li>
	<li>Find a random bar within reasonable walking distance</li>
	<li>Plot the directions</li>
	<li>Make wildly liberal use of the F-word the entire time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thirsty? <a href="http://www.darshanshakya.com/drinks" targe="_blank">Yep.</a></p>
